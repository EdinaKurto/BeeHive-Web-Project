# BeeHive-Web-Project


BeeHive is a fully realized single-page web application developed as a project for IT207 – Web Programming at the International Burch University. It serves as a modern e-commerce platform focused on showcasing and selling natural honey and honey-based products, blending a smooth shopping experience for customers with a comprehensive admin dashboard for content and business management. At its core, BeeHive helps local honey producers by giving them a beautifully designed digital storefront. 

Built on a robust technology stack of PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL, BeeHive is divided into a clean RESTful backend, developed using the FlightPHP micro-framework with PDO for secure database access, and a dynamic frontend crafted with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), jQuery, and SPApp for seamless client-side routing.

Users can explore a catalog of products, view detailed product pages, add items to their cart, and checkout with ease. Meanwhile, administrators can securely log in to a dedicated dashboard to manage products, users, orders, categories, blog posts, and customer reviews—all through fully implemented CRUD functionality.
